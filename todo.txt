* README / Docs
* Examples
* Test help and usage
* Test subcommands
* Have a more structured approach to testing and not just a "throw shit against the wall"-testing. Try to cover all branches individually.
* Add a way to configure the name of a flag value ("metavar")
* Hex/Octal/Binary Numbers (though if you need them, you can add your own Value specialization)
* Make check for superfluous arguments optional and collect to remaining() instead
* Split implementations and internal stuff to the bottom of the file? Move some code into a single source file?
