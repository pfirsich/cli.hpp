* vector Param
* Rework everything, because it doesn't make sense
* Support for passing a flag multiple times (and collecting into a vector). How to arrange with --foo 1 2 3 vs. --foo 1 --foo 2?
* Flag containing '=': --flag=0, maybe -f=0?
* README / Docs
* Examples
* Negative numbers
* Concatenated flag and value: -f0 (what should be the rules here?)
* Test help and usage
* Probably a million things in help/usage strings
* Make check for superfluous arguments optional and collect to remaining() instead
* Split implementations and internal stuff to the bottom of the file?
