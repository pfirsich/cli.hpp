* Proper usage string
* optional Param
* vector Param
* numbers
* Flag containing '=': --flag=0, maybe -f=0?
* Concatenated flag and value: -f0 (what should be the rules here?)
* Custom data types: You could add custom Flag/Param specializations, but you would have to add one for T, optional<T>, vector<T> times two (Flag and Param). It would be cool if you could just specify the parsing function once.
* Custom validation functions?
* More Examples
* How to test --help, --version and error messages?
* remaining() - just enable this in parser and collect them instead of error-ing
* Split implementations and internal stuff to the bottom of the file?
