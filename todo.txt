* README / Docs
* Examples
* Negative numbers
* Concatenated flag and value: -f0 (what should be the rules here?). Wanting to support number flags mags this tricky.
* Be smarter with '--flag=value' and make sure that it's only used for a flag that actually takes a (single) value
* Test help and usage
* Make check for superfluous arguments optional and collect to remaining() instead
* Split implementations and internal stuff to the bottom of the file? Move some code into a single source file?
