* README / Docs
* Examples
* Negative numbers
* Concatenated flag and value: -f0 (what should be the rules here?). Wanting to support number flags mags this tricky.
* Allow non-optional after "many", i.e. `source [source..] dest` (for e.g. `cp`).
  This probably means I need to add backtracking and it might be tricky (e.g. `[cool..] [okay..] [bad..]`)
* Test help and usage
* Make check for superfluous arguments optional and collect to remaining() instead
* Split implementations and internal stuff to the bottom of the file? Move some code into a single source file?
